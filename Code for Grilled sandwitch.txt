    <p>Grilled bread has a crunch and buttery flavor that plain toast just can’t deliver.
         Here, our sweet approach to grilled cheese features fruity jam and melty cream cheese, 
         for a hot breakfast sandwich that takes as little time to make as waiting in line for a bagel. 
         However, we think it works just as well as a breakfast-for-dinner dish. </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 (1/2-inch-thick, 3-1/2-by-3-1/2-inch-long) slices white sandwich bread</li>
        <li>1/3 cup cream cheese</li>
        <li>1/4 cup strawberry jam or preserves</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
    </ul>
